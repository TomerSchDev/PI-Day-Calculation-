# PI-Day-Calculation-
Calculate Pi the old fashioned way

In this pograme we will calculate PI the old fashioned way ! by calculating the different of the perimeter of the shapes that one contains a circle and the other is blocked by the same circle.

The pogram starts with a shape of 4 vertices (squere) and will give a rougth asstimate of PI

But the user can chose to use more vertices or less in real time!

By pressing the right key, the number of vertices will grow by 1
By pressing the left key, the number of vertices will decrese by 1 (to a minimum of 3)

There  is a GUI to show you the circle and the points and the vertices
